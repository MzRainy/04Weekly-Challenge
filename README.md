## Create a Quiz using Web API
```
I HAVE created a code quiz
WHEN the start button is clicked
THEN a timer starts and a question is presented
WHEN the question is answered
THEN another question is asked
WHEN an answer is incorrectly, time is subtracted
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over and you can record your name and score.
